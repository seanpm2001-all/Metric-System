# Metric SI meter units proposal

This is my planned proposal to the expansion of the Metric System from June/July 2019/2020. They were made public a few days ago, and were made into a separate file on a separate repository on July 22nd 2021 at 7:01 pm.

## Existing units

1. Kilometer

## New units

These are for the units equal to powers of 10 (1000m = 1 km, etc.)

1. 1 Megameter (MM) = 1,000,000 meters, or 1,000 kilometers

2. 1 Gigameter (GM) = 1,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 megameters, or 1,000,000 kilometers

3. 1 Terameter (TM) = 1,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000 kilometers

4. 1 Petameter (PM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 terameters, or 1,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 kilometers

5. 1 Exameter (EM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 petameters, or 1,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

6. 1 Zettameter (ZM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 exameters, or 1,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

7. 1 Yottameter (YM) = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters, or 1,000 zettameters, or 1,000,000 exameters, or 1,000,000,000 petameters, or 1,000,000,000,000 terameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 gigameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 megameters, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers

... And so on ...

These are for the units equal to powers of 2 (1024m = 1 kim, etc.)

1. 1 Kibimeter (1 KiM) = 2^10 meters

2. 1 Mebimeter (1 MiM) = 1024^2 meters

3. 1 Gibimeter (1 GiM) = 1024^3 meters

4. 1 Tebimeter (1 TiM) = 1024^4 meters

5. 1 Pebimeter (1 PiM) = 1024^5 meters

6. 1 Exbimeter (1 EiM) = 1024^6 meters

7. 1 Zebimeter (1 ZiM) = 1024^7 meters

8. 1 Yobimeter (1 YiM) = 1024^8 meters

... and so on ...

## Notes

1. I am not sure if Megameter can be used.

2. 1 KiM (Kibimeter) is not to be confused with the surname of Kim

3. 1 MiM (Mebimeter) is not to be confused with the word Mime

4. 1 TiM (Tebimeter) is not to be confused with the surname of Tim/Timothy

5. 1 PM (Petameter) is not to be confused with the time 1:00 pm/13:00

6. Terameter (TM) is not trademarked, and is not to be confused with the concept/symbol of TM (TradeMark)

7. 1 GM (Gigameter) is not to be confused with the General Motors auto company

8. 1 MM (Megameter) is not to be confused with 1 Millimeter, a second reason why Megameter may not be usable

9. No other notes at the moment.
